# Homework 1: ER diagram

## Overview

Draw a plausible ER diagram for the dataset contained in the
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/139pyFacFn594tCqxuORAvUFx3I7kBRao4Ev42rmxtDI) I shared with you
on the first day. There may be multiple valid interpretations of this dataset.

Items the drawing should include:

* Entities
* Attributes for each entity
* Relationships and their names
* Relationship cardinalities

Use the appropriate conventions.

## Tool

## What to hand in

Hand in a PDF of your drawing.

## A dataset

For most of this semester we will play with the
[City of Portland Tree Inventory](https://gis-pdx.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c2b02440053f459db71e1109b9947e51_1415/explore).

## Relationships

Does the City of Portland Tree Inventory include at least one one-to-many
relationship? And at least one many-to-many relationship?

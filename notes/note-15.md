# Note 15

## An example database

Last week we saw the example of a database [schema](./registrar-schema.sql).
Today we will populate the database with [data](./registrar-data.sql).

## Activity

Assuming you have a user called `registrar` that has full privileges on a
database of the same name, but no others, and assuming you have already loaded
the schema, please follow these steps:

* Inspect the [data file](./registrar-data.sql).
* Load the data contained in that file.
* Run an SQL query to list the content of one of the tables.
* Run any query that has been mentioned in the textbook so far.

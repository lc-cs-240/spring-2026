# Note 13

## SQL style guide

> the key here is that you pick a style and stick to it  
> -- Simon Holywell

> code is read much more often than it is written  
> -- Guido van Rossum

> A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is
> important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within
> one module or function is the most important.

> However, know when to be inconsistent — sometimes style guide recommendations
> just aren’t applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other
> examples and decide what looks best.
